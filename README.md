Underwater_Image_Restoration

About the Project :
Due to the physical properties of underwater, capturing clear images is challenging.
The effects of absorption and scattering as well as the varying attenuation of light in
different wavelengths cause degradation of underwater images. 

The project aims to restore the color of underwater images using Blue-Green Channels Dehazing
and Red Channel Correction. The image is enhanced by adaptive exposure mapping method.

How to run:
1.Download and extract the code
2.Open main.py file and set path of sample_image and result path.
3.Put the input images in sample_images folder.
4.You can see the resulted images in the result folder.
5.Run python main.py.
